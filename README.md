# Hi, I'm Hanni 👋

I am a curious physicist with passion for software development and an additional degree in whole sales and foreign trade certified by the German chamber of commerce (IHK). I got a great interest in taking on new programming challenges. During my physics studies at the University of Tübingen, Germany, I did a research internship at the European Space Agency (ESA, Madrid) and worked in the astrophysics group of the university.
